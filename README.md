# What Kind of Classmate Are You? Quiz 🎉

## 🚀 What’s This All About?

This quiz asks you a series of questions — but here’s the twist: every answer you pick leads to a different next question, like a “choose your own adventure” book. After 8 to 10 questions, it nails down your *classmate character* — the real you, or at least your classroom spirit animal.

Built with plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it runs entirely in your browser. No internet required once you’ve got it loaded (although sharing it online is super easy with GitHub Pages).

## 🛠️ How Does It Work?

Under the hood, the quiz uses a clever **question tree** stored in JavaScript. Each answer points to a different next question, so your path through the quiz is totally unique. This way, no two quizzes have to feel the same.

The UI is designed to be simple and colorful with big buttons and emojis to keep things fun and engaging — no boring text-only quizzes here!
